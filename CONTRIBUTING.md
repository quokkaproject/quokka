Ready to contribute? Here’s how to set up Quokka CMS
for local development.

1.  Fork the [quokka](https://github.com/rochacbruno/quokka) repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

        $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/quokka.git
        $ cd quokka/

3.  Install your local copy into a virtualenv:

        $ make create_env
        $ . venv/bin/activate
        $ make install

4. Run Quokka:

        $ make devserver

5.  Create a branch for local development:

        $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

6.  When you’re done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8
    and the tests:

        $ make test

7.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        $ git add .
        $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

8.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website or github CLI.
