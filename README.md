Quokka is a flexible content management platform powered by Python, Flask and MongoDB.


Quick start
============

> You need a MongoDB instance running locally or remotely to connect. 
> Quokka runs on Python 2.7

1. Get Quokka

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/quokkaproject/quokka
$ cd quokka
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Define your MongoDB settings

```bash
$ $EDITOR quokka/local_settings.py
===============quokka/quokka/local_settings.py===============
MONGODB_SETTINGS = {'DB': 'your_mongo_db'}
DEBUG = True
=============================================================
```

3. Populate with sample data (optional)

```bash
$ python manage.py populate 

```

4. Create a superuser

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
you@email.com
P4$$W0Rd
```

5. Run

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```
6. Access on http://localhost:5000 
7. Admin on http://localhost:5000/admin

or by making your server reachable on other networks

```bash
$ python manage.py run0
```
6. Access on http://0.0.0.0:8000

Hosting
=======

You can host a Quokka website in any VPS or cloud which supports Python and Flask + MongoDB access, a good option is to host the database in MongoLab if your hosting server does not provide Mongo.

- PythonAnywhere can run Quokka with Mongo hosted at MongoLab
- DigitalOcean is a good option for a VPS
- Jelastic Cloud has the easiest Quokka deployment - http://docs.jelastic.com/ru/quokka-cms

Is it any good?

## FAQ

### Why another CMS?

There is a large number of great CMS's in Python ecosystem (Plone, Opps, Mezannine, DjangoCMS etc), each one has its own patterns for extension development and theme management. A CMS can take a its role as "Product" or as "Platform" and for Quokka the idea is to play in both scenarios, The CMS should be easy to deploy, extensions and themes should be "drop-in", it should be easy to develop extensions and also it should use a "schema-free" database. Until Quokka there was no CMS filling all these needs.

### Why Flask?

Because Flask is Pythonic! In my research + experience it is the best framework to develop applications which rely on "pluggable features" thanks to its Blueprints and Extension patterns, also Flask plays well with any DB/ORM of choice. (see next question) 

### Why MongoDB?

Because database scheme migrations are no-happy for CMS and a Quokka CMS must be always happy to work with, so no-schema-migrations is needed with MongoDB! and Mongo is the easiest, flexible and most suitable NoSQL for CMS, also there is excellent extensions for Flask (MongoEngine and Flask-Admin) which supports MongoDB!

### Why the project is named "Quokka?"

Because it is the happiest animal in the world!
